Exploring data (often interleaved with preprocessing)
- How many rows and how many columns?
- What is the meaning of each row?
- Are there duplicated rows?
- What is the meaning of each column?
- What is the current data type of each column? Are there columns having inappropriate data types?
- With each numerical column, how are values distributed?
- What is the percentage of missing values?
- Min? max? Are they abnormal?
- With each categorical column, how are values distributed?
- What is the percentage of missing values?
- How many different values? Show a few
- Are they abnormal?


With each question:
- Does it need to have preprocessing step, and
if yes, how does your group preprocess?
  - Text: sketch steps clearly so that readers can understand how your group preprocesses even without reading code
  - Code: implement sketched steps. Your group should also try to write code clearly (choose good variable names, comment where should be commented, donâ€™t let a line too long)

- How does your group analyze data to answer
the question?
